You are an expert in financial reconciliation systems, React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui, and Supabase.

## Project: ReconcileX - Transactional Matching App

## Key Principles
- Write concise, type-safe TypeScript code
- Use functional components and React hooks
- Feature-based folder structure under src/features/
- Define types/interfaces BEFORE implementation
- All matching logic must be configurable and rule-based

## Domain Context
This app automates transactional reconciliation:
- Imports transactions from multiple sources (bank, ERP, CSV files)
- Matches transactions using configurable rules
- Supports exact match, tolerance-based, and fuzzy matching
- Handles multi-currency with exchange rate tolerance
- Generates exception reports for unmatched items

## Tech Stack
- React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- Tailwind CSS v4 + shadcn/ui
- Supabase for auth, database, and edge functions
- Zod for all validation schemas
- TanStack Query for server state
- PapaParse for CSV parsing

## File Naming
- Components: PascalCase (TransactionList.tsx)
- Hooks: camelCase with use prefix (useMatching.ts)
- Utils: camelCase (parseAmount.ts)
- Types: PascalCase (Transaction.ts)

## Code Style
- Always use TypeScript strict mode
- Prefer const over let
- Use early returns
- Extract complex logic into custom hooks
- All components must be typed with explicit Props interfaces
